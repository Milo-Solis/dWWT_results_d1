# dWWT_results_d1
Example of results of the meta-analysis, obtained from 11 sources. 
The code collects and filters the data for two impact categories: GWP in KgCO2e and FEUT in KgPO4e. It harmonises the results into PE yr, and displays the results compiled per WW technology. The polot also shows the mean value of each WW configuration. 
The WW configuration of this example is broad (i.e.: constructed wetland, without going into the detail of whether this is horizontal or vertical flow. This data is collected).
